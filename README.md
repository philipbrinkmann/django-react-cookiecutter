# Django + React Cookiecutter

The Django + React Cookiecutter uses the Python tool `cookiecutter` to create a basic folder structure for a new Django + React project and populate it with default files and configuration. To use it, you need to have `cookiecutter` installed:

    pip install cookiecutter

## Start a new project using this cookiecutter

To start a new project using the Django + React Cookiecutter, first navigate to the parent directory of your project (the directory in which the project folder will be created). Afterwards run:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/rogerfn/django-react-cookiecutter.git

You will be prompted for a name of the project folder, as well as a slug that will be used in the git url. Finally, navigate to the newly created project folder and start developing (e.g. initialise git with `git init`).
